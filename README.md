# EaseAmpRedis
> A very simple and safe PHP library that provides methods to access redis cache in php applications. This wraps up the AmPHP related Redis Package to interact with Redis in-memory cache in an asynchronous & non-blocking way.

### Advantages
- Query Redis Cache in asynchronous & non-blocking way

### Getting started
With Composer, run

```sh
composer require invincible-tech-systems/easeampredis:^1.0.1
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PDOLight.

To include the library,

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use InvincibleTechSystems\EaseAmpRedis\EaseAmpRedis;
```

As Amphp/dns is among the dependencies of this library, to prevent recursive DNS Server resolution errors that may occur due reasons like open_basedir restrictions/ no access to /etc/resolv.conf file on the linux server etc..., do include the following lines in your code,

```php

use \InvincibleTechSystems\EaseAmpRedis\CustomAmphpDnsConfigLoader;

$customAmphpDnsConfigValues = ["208.67.222.222:53", "208.67.220.220:53","8.8.8.8:53","[2001:4860:4860::8888]:53"];

$CustomAmphpDnsConfigLoader = new CustomAmphpDnsConfigLoader($customAmphpDnsConfigValues, 5000, 3);

\Amp\Dns\resolver(new \Amp\Dns\Rfc1035StubResolver(null, $CustomAmphpDnsConfigLoader));

```

Note: Do skip including the above, if incase similar custom DNS Config Loader is loaded from any of the other Amphp/dns dependent libraries like EaseAmyMysql (https://github.com/invincible-tech-systems/easeamp-mysql) or EaseAmpMysqlRedis (https://github.com/invincible-tech-systems/easeamp-mysql-redis) in the application.
